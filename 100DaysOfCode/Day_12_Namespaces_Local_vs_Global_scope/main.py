Day 12 - Namespaces

Namespaces: Are virtual spaces where the names of variables, functions, classes, or other elements are uniquely defined within that space, helping to avoid naming conflicts and organize the code.

Placeholder: It is a temporary value used in code to represent data that will be determined later. It is commonly used to represent unknown or null values or to indicate where the user should enter data in forms.

Local vs Global scope
